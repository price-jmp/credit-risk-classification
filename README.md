Homework for Module 20 - Supervised Machine Learning

This dataset had 77536 rows and 8 columns of all numeric data on the status/health of loans (healthy vs high-risk). The independent variables included: loan size, interest rate, borrower income, debt-to-income ratio, number of accounts, derogatory marks and total debt. The target data, or dependent variable, in this set was the loan status. In this assignment, a Logistic Regression model was used to try and accurately predict the loan status. 

The data was processed through a Standard Scaler and a Logistic Regression model.
